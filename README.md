# Face ID System for Person Retrieval Using LFW Dataset

## Overview

This project aims to develop a **Face ID System** that can retrieve information about a person from the **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)** dataset using only their image. The system should be capable of recognizing a person from a single reference image, returning their corresponding ID from the dataset.

We will implement the system using a **single Python notebook**, where we will load the **LFW dataset** and build a modular system for **one-shot face recognition**. The system will be capable of handling face recognition efficiently and return the corresponding ID from a set of 1000+ people.

## Technical Requirements

* **Dataset**: LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset (with 1000+ people).
* **Architecture**: Must be scalable to handle up to **250 million images** (considering 1 image per person from the estimated population ).
* **One-Shot Recognition**: The system must recognize individuals using just **1 reference image**.
* **Modular Training Pipeline**:

  * Dataset Preparation
  * Hyperparameter Tuning
  * Loss Function
* **Modular Inference Pipeline**:

  * Switch between a custom trained and pretrained backbone.
  * Retrieve a person’s ID using their face image.

## Architecture

### 1. Dataset Preparation

For this project, we will use the **LFW dataset**, which contains images of 1000+ individuals. The dataset will be processed to extract facial features and assigned IDs based on the image labels.

### 2. Modular Training Pipeline

The training pipeline will be designed in a modular way, ensuring we can tweak various components easily.

* **Dataset Class**: We will implement a custom dataset class to load and preprocess the LFW images efficiently.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Key hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and network architecture configurations, will be tuned.
* **Loss Function**: A suitable loss function will be selected for face recognition, such as  **Contrastive Loss**, which works well for one-shot recognition.

### 3. Inference Pipeline

The inference pipeline will allow us to run predictions using a custom trained or pretrained model. The following will be implemented:

* **Single-Shot Recognition**: At inference time, we will use one reference image per person for recognition.
* **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: The recognition will be powered by the KNN algorithm, which matches the input image to the closest image in the feature space.
* **Vector Database**: A vector database will be used to store feature vectors of the faces and match them efficiently during inference.

## Pipeline Setup

### 1. Dataset Class and Preparation

We will load the **LFW dataset** and prepare a custom dataset class to handle the training and testing examples.

* **Image Preprocessing**:

  * Resize images to a standard size (e.g., 224x224).
  * Normalize pixel values.
* **Label Encoding**: Assign a unique ID to each person in the dataset.

### 2. Training the Model

* **Backbone Selection**: The backbone architecture (e.g., ResNet, Inception, etc.) will be chosen for feature extraction.
* **Loss Function**:

  * **Contrastive Loss** could be used as an alternative.
* **Training Process**:

  * Train the model on the LFW dataset.
  * Fine-tune the model with hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size.

### 3. Inference Pipeline

* **Single Shot Recognition**: During inference, a single image will be passed through the model to retrieve the corresponding ID.
* **KNN Classifier**: The KNN algorithm will compare the input image's feature vector to those in the vector database, returning the ID of the closest match.
* **Switching Between Models**: The code will allow switching between custom-trained and pretrained models for inference.

## Inference Details

The core functionality of the system is to **recognize a person using a single reference image**.

Here is how the inference will work:

1. **Input Image**: A new image is provided for face recognition.
2. **Feature Extraction**: The image is passed through the trained model (either custom or pretrained), which extracts a feature vector.
3. **Matching**: The feature vector is compared with the vectors in the vector database using KNN.
4. **ID Retrieval**: The person’s ID is returned based on the closest match.

## Evaluation and Results

* **Evaluation Metrics**: The system’s accuracy will be evaluated using standard face recognition benchmarks such as **True Positive Rate (TPR)**, **False Positive Rate (FPR)**, and **Precision-Recall**.
* **Analysis**: The system's performance will be analyzed with both custom-trained and pretrained models, comparing inference times and accuracy.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how we can build a **Face ID system** using the **LFW dataset** for **one-shot face recognition**. The system is designed to be highly modular, allowing easy integration of different backbones, loss functions, and inference techniques. This approach could be extended to more complex, large-scale applications in real-world face recognition systems.
