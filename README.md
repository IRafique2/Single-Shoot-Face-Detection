# Face ID System for Person Retrieval Using LFW Dataset

## Overview

This project develops a **Face ID system** that retrieves a person's ID from the **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)** dataset using a single image. The system focuses on **one-shot face recognition** and can identify a person by comparing their face to a dataset of 1000+ individuals.

The project uses a **single Python notebook** to process the dataset, train a custom model, and perform face recognition.

## Technical Requirements

* **Dataset**: LFW dataset (1000+ individuals).
* **One-Shot Recognition**: Recognize a person from just one reference image.
* **Architecture**: Scalable for handling large datasets (up to 250 million images).
* **Modular Training and Inference Pipelines**:

  * Dataset preparation and class implementation.
  * Hyperparameter tuning, loss function design (Contrastive Loss).
  * Inference with both custom and pretrained backbones, using **KNN** and a **vector database**.

## Architecture

### 1. Dataset Preparation

We will preprocess the **LFW dataset**, resize images to 224x224, and normalize them. Each individual will be assigned a unique ID.

### 2. Training Pipeline

* **Backbone Selection**: Choose an architecture (e.g., ResNet) for feature extraction.
* **Loss Function**: Use **Contrastive Loss** for training.
* **Training**: Fine-tune the model on the LFW dataset with the right hyperparameters.

### 3. Inference Pipeline

* **Single-Shot Recognition**: For a given image, retrieve the closest matching ID using KNN.
* **KNN Classifier**: Compare the feature vector of the input image to those in the vector database.
* **Model Switching**: Allow switching between custom-trained and pretrained models for inference.

## Evaluation and Results

* Evaluate the systemâ€™s **accuracy** using **True Positive Rate (TPR)** and **False Positive Rate (FPR)**.
* Analyze the performance of custom-trained vs. pretrained models.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* PyTorch
* scikit-learn
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
